Day 1: On-Premise Environment
Challenges: High cost, maintenance (software/hardware), scalability issues, underutilization.
Virtualization:
Hypervisor software is required to create isolated VMs.
Standalone virtualization risks downtime if the physical hardware fails.
Private Cloud: Highly available clusters managed with tools like System Center, OpenStack, VMware vSphere, or Azure Stack.
Day 2: Public Cloud
Advantages:
No CapEx, guaranteed scalability, no resource underutilization.
Managed by cloud providers (AWS, Azure, IBM).
Shared Responsibility Model: Security is a shared responsibility between the customer and the cloud provider.
Azure Features:
Pay-as-you-go, hybrid benefits for licensing, global regions for VM creation.
Deployment models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
Day 3: Service Models
IaaS: Provides VMs; user manages OS and runtime.
PaaS: Platform for application development (e.g., App Services, SQL Database).
SaaS: Fully managed applications (e.g., Office 365, Google Drive).
Day 4: Azure Hierarchy and Identity
Hierarchy: Subscription → Resource Groups → Resources.
Tenancy: Azure Entra ID creates a tenant representing the organization.
Subscription Types: Free Trial, Pay-as-you-go, Cloud Solution Partner, Student.
Azure Policy: Used for governance, e.g., enabling Defender for Cloud for all subscriptions.
Day 6-7: Azure CLI & PowerShell
CLI Commands:
az account list, az group create, az group delete, az vm create.
PowerShell Commands:
Get-AzSubscription, New-AzResourceGroup, New-AzVM.
VM Connectivity:
Windows VM: Connect via RDP.
Linux VM: Use SSH tools like MobaXterm.
Day 8-9: Azure Disks
Types: OS Disk, Data Disk, Temporary Disk.
Disk Operations: Add disks, change sizes (requires deallocation for OS disks).
Snapshots: Create point-in-time copies for recovery.
Availability Sets: Protect against planned maintenance and hardware failures.
Day 11-14: Azure Storage
Types: Blob, File, Table, Queue.
Access Tiers: Hot, Cool, Archive (rehydration required for Archive).
Replication: LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA-GRS, etc., based on redundancy needs.
Migration: Use tools like AzCopy, Azure File Sync, Data Box for data migration.
Day 15: Azure App Services and Containers
App Services: Managed platform for web apps, deployment slots for testing.
Containers:
Create images locally with Docker and push to Azure Container Registry.
Deploy images as Azure Container Instances or Kubernetes pods.
Day 16: Networking
IP Addressing:
IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit).
Classes: A, B, C for network and host differentiation.
Subnetting: Reduces IP wastage; enables private communication within defined ranges.
Reserved IPs:
Public IP: Used in WAN.
Private IP: Used in LAN.
NAT (Network Address Translation): Converts private IPs to public IPs for external communication.
Azure VNet: Virtual networks in Azure for resource isolation and communication.

Network Basics
WAN (Wide Area Network): Connectivity to the internet, uses public IP addresses.
LAN (Local Area Network): Private internal network, uses private IP addresses.
Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
Definition: A VNet is a private network in Azure, equivalent to a LAN in on-premises environments.
Scope: VNets are region-specific (e.g., a VM in South India can't connect to a VNet in Central India directly).
Address Pool: Defines the range of private IPs for the VNet.
Subnets are created from this pool.
Example: VNet with 10.0.0.0/16, Subnet1 with 10.0.0.0/24, Subnet2 with 10.0.1.0/24.
Creating a VNet in Azure
Go to Azure Portal: Search for "Virtual Network".

Create a New VNet:

Select your subscription.
Create/select a resource group.
Name your VNet (e.g., MyVNet).
Choose a region (e.g., Central India).
Define the IP address pool (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
Rename the default subnet (e.g., VMSubnet).
Add additional subnets (e.g., TestSubnet with a non-overlapping CIDR range).
Review and Create: Finalize the settings and deploy the VNet.

Virtual Machines in VNets
Private IPs: Assigned from the subnet, default to dynamic but can be changed to static.
Public IPs: Used for external communication, default to static.
To change private IP allocation:
Navigate to the VM's network interface card.
Go to IP configuration settings.
Change IP allocation from dynamic to static.
Subnets and Communication
Within the Same VNet:
Communication between subnets in the same VNet is allowed by default.
Azure manages routing with system-assigned routes.
Between Different VNets:
No communication by default.
VNet Peering is required to enable communication.
Testing Connectivity
VM to VM (Same Subnet):
Use private IPs for communication.
VM to VM (Different Subnets, Same VNet):
Allowed by default.
Use RDP with private IP.
Example: mstsc /v:<private-ip-of-vm>.
Public IP and Internet Access
If a VM's public IP is removed:
The VM can still access the internet.
A random public IP is assigned by Azure for outbound connections.
This behavior is managed by the default VNet settings.
Hands-On Example
Create two VMs:
VM1 in VMSubnet.
VM2 in TestSubnet.
Access:
Take RDP to VM1 using its public IP.
From VM1, take RDP to VM2 using its private IP.
Test Internet:
Open a browser on either VM and search "What is my IP?".
Even without a public IP on the VM, it will show an outbound public IP assigned by Azure.
