Day 16: Networking
IP Addressing:
IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit).
Classes: A, B, C for network and host differentiation.
Subnetting: Reduces IP wastage; enables private communication within defined ranges.
Reserved IPs:
Public IP: Used in WAN.
Private IP: Used in LAN.
NAT (Network Address Translation): Converts private IPs to public IPs for external communication.
Azure VNet: Virtual networks in Azure for resource isolation and communication.

Network Basics
WAN (Wide Area Network): Connectivity to the internet, uses public IP addresses.
LAN (Local Area Network): Private internal network, uses private IP addresses.
Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
Definition: A VNet is a private network in Azure, equivalent to a LAN in on-premises environments.
Scope: VNets are region-specific (e.g., a VM in South India can't connect to a VNet in Central India directly).
Address Pool: Defines the range of private IPs for the VNet.
Subnets are created from this pool.
Example: VNet with 10.0.0.0/16, Subnet1 with 10.0.0.0/24, Subnet2 with 10.0.1.0/24.
Creating a VNet in Azure
Go to Azure Portal: Search for "Virtual Network".

Create a New VNet:

Select your subscription.
Create/select a resource group.
Name your VNet (e.g., MyVNet).
Choose a region (e.g., Central India).
Define the IP address pool (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
Rename the default subnet (e.g., VMSubnet).
Add additional subnets (e.g., TestSubnet with a non-overlapping CIDR range).
Review and Create: Finalize the settings and deploy the VNet.

Virtual Machines in VNets
Private IPs: Assigned from the subnet, default to dynamic but can be changed to static.
Public IPs: Used for external communication, default to static.
To change private IP allocation:
Navigate to the VM's network interface card.
Go to IP configuration settings.
Change IP allocation from dynamic to static.
Subnets and Communication
Within the Same VNet:
Communication between subnets in the same VNet is allowed by default.
Azure manages routing with system-assigned routes.
Between Different VNets:
No communication by default.
VNet Peering is required to enable communication.
Testing Connectivity
VM to VM (Same Subnet):
Use private IPs for communication.
VM to VM (Different Subnets, Same VNet):
Allowed by default.
Use RDP with private IP.
Example: mstsc /v:<private-ip-of-vm>.
Public IP and Internet Access
If a VM's public IP is removed:
The VM can still access the internet.
A random public IP is assigned by Azure for outbound connections.
This behavior is managed by the default VNet settings.
Hands-On Example
Create two VMs:
VM1 in VMSubnet.
VM2 in TestSubnet.
Access:
Take RDP to VM1 using its public IP.
From VM1, take RDP to VM2 using its private IP.
Test Internet:
Open a browser on either VM and search "What is my IP?".
Even without a public IP on the VM, it will show an outbound public IP assigned by Azure.



Notes on VNet-to-VNet Connectivity, DNS, and VPN in Azure
1. VNet-to-VNet Connectivity Using Gateway Device
Key Concepts:

VNet Peering: Allows communication between resources in different VNets, connected over the Azure backbone. It requires non-overlapping address spaces.
VNet-to-VNet using Gateway: Involves creating a secure, encrypted tunnel between two VNets over the internet.
Steps:

Create VNets:

Go to Azure Portal > Virtual Networks and create two VNets in different regions (e.g., Central India and Central US).
Make sure the address spaces are non-overlapping. For example, VNet 1 might have the address space 10.0.0.0/16 and VNet 2 10.1.0.0/16.
Create Gateway Subnet:

For VPN Gateway configuration, you need to create a Gateway Subnet in each VNet. This subnet should have a specific address range.
Go to the Subnets section of your VNet and add a Gateway subnet. Azure reserves certain address ranges for this subnet.
Deploy Virtual Network Gateways:

Go to Virtual Network Gateway in Azure Portal and deploy a VPN Gateway.
Choose the appropriate VPN type (Route-based or Policy-based). Ensure Active-Active mode is disabled.
Set up the VPN tunnel to allow communication between the two VNets via the virtual network gateways.
Create VNet Peering:

Go to VNet Peering in the Azure Portal and create a peering connection between the two VNets, ensuring that both VNets can route traffic to each other.
Set up bi-directional traffic and configure remote gateway for cross-region peering if needed.
Testing:

Create VMs in both VNets, one in Central India and one in Central US.
Test connectivity using tools like ping, tracert, or PowerShell’s Test-NetConnection to verify VNet-to-VNet connectivity.
2. VPN Connections
Key Types:

Site-to-Site VPN (S2S): This type of VPN connects your on-premises network to your Azure VNet. Typically, you need an on-premises VPN device that supports IPsec or IKEv2.
Point-to-Site VPN (P2S): Used for individual devices (e.g., laptops or workstations) to securely connect to Azure. You’ll use a VPN client on the device to establish the connection.
Steps:

Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN:
Configure VPN devices on both ends (on-premises and Azure) to establish a secure tunnel.
In Azure, create a Virtual Network Gateway and configure the connection type (IPsec/IKEv2).
Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN:
Set up a VPN client on the individual device that you want to connect to Azure.
The VPN client will authenticate using certificates and establish a secure connection to Azure.
3. DNS Configuration
Key Concepts:

DNS (Domain Name System): Translates domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses, allowing users and devices to access websites or services using human-readable addresses.
Azure DNS: Azure provides both Public DNS for global internet traffic and Private DNS for internal Azure VNet communication.
Public DNS Configuration:

Create DNS Zone in Azure:

In Azure Portal, go to DNS Zones and create a new DNS zone (e.g., example.com).
Create A Record in Azure DNS:

In the created DNS zone, add an A record that maps a hostname (e.g., www) to the public IP address of your Azure VM.
Update DNS Records in GoDaddy:

Log into GoDaddy and go to the DNS settings for your domain.
Update the nameservers to point to Azure’s DNS servers (you can find Azure's nameservers in the Azure DNS Zone properties).
Private DNS Configuration:

Create Private DNS Zone:
In Azure, create a Private DNS Zone for internal DNS resolution (e.g., internal.example.com).
Link DNS Zone to VNet:
In the DNS zone, go to Virtual Network Links and link the zone to the appropriate VNets for internal resolution.
NSLookup Testing:
From a VM in the linked VNet, use nslookup to verify that the VM can resolve names from the private DNS zone.
Example: nslookup indvm.simplykloud.com will resolve to the private IP of indvm.
4. IIS Web Server Installation on VM
Steps:

Install IIS on Windows VM:
Log into the Windows VM.
Run the following PowerShell command to install the IIS Web Server:
powershell
Copy
Install-WindowsFeature -Name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
Configure Network Security Group (NSG):
Ensure that the NSG associated with the VM allows inbound HTTP traffic (port 80).
Test Web Server:
Open a browser and access the VM’s public IP to confirm IIS is up and running.
You should see the default IIS landing page.
5. Configuring A Record in GoDaddy (DNS)
Login to GoDaddy:
Go to GoDaddy and log into your account.
Create an A Record:
Navigate to DNS Management for your domain.
Add an A record that points to the public IP address of the VM running the IIS Web Server.
Update Name Servers:
In GoDaddy, update the Name Servers for your domain to those provided by Azure DNS.
